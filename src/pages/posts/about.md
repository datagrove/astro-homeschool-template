### Who are we?

The Oswego Homeschool Association is a non-profit group for homeschooling parents and children of all ages. We believe that parents are the primary teachers and are responsible for all lawful reporting, curricula choices, and core subject instruction. OHA aims to support the role of the parent by offering meetings, special events, field trips, and educational opportunities. We are an inclusive, eclectic, local, member-run organization that honors the diversity of homeschoolers and provides a supportive community for our members. Our reasons for homeschooling differ, as do our styles and approaches to education. What we share is a respect for all learners and a desire to support one another.

### What we offer?

OHA is very happy to provide a broad range of extracurricular and supplemental activies to Oswego's homeschool community. As an OHA member, your child can participate in our Lakeside Enrichment and Academic Program (LEAP), choir, theatrical performances, ROYALS athletics, and more. Our programs are ever changing and we are always looking for ways to enrich our children's lives.
