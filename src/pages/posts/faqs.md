### Mission Statement

The Oswego Homeschool Association is a not for profit 501c3 organization for homeschooling parents and children of all ages. We believe that parents are the primary teachers and are responsible for all lawful reporting, curricula choices, and core subject instruction. OHA aims to support the role of the parent by offering meetings, special events, field trips, and educational opportunities. We are an inclusive, eclectic, local, member-run organization that honors the diversity of homeschoolers and provides a supportive community for our members. Our reasons for homeschooling differ, as do our styles and approaches to education. What we share is a respect for all learners and a desire to support one another.e believe that every family has the legal and constitutional right to home educate in New York State, regardless of their philosophy of education or religious affiliation.

### What about LEAH, are you also LEAH?

The Oswego Homeschool Association is a local chapter of Loving Education at Home, Inc- also known as Homeschool NY/LEAH (click here for more information about Homeschool NY/LEAH). We are an affiliate of this state organization, but OHA is also our own autonomous entity. Our board developed our own bylaws which are unique to OHA. These bylaws differ from other Homeschool NY/LEAH chapters and have been submitted to and accepted by Homeschool NY/LEAH. Per our mission, we choose to be welcoming to homeschoolers of all faiths and beliefs, as outlined specifically in our bylaws:

### Are there more than one Homeschool NY/LEAH chapters in Oswego County?

Yes! We have such a great need for homeschool support in this area. OHA is one of several chapters in the area. The other chapters include Oswego County Leah, James Madison Academy, Raising Arrows, and Mexico Lighthouse LEAH.

</div>
<div>

### Can I be a member of both OHA and Oswego County LEAH?

Yes! It’s called dual enrollment. You can save some money this way, too. Families choose one of the chapters to be their “primary chapter” and pay the membership fee. Then, they will pay what the other (secondary) chapter charges, minus $30 (which is what goes to Homeschool NY/LEAH). Each chapter may have differing requirements for membership. Membership to Homeschool NY/LEAH does not necessarily guarantee a membership into any particular chapter and membership in one chapter does not guarantee membership in another chapter.

### Is OHA exclusively secular?

No, we are not. We are inclusive to all walks of life. We are religion neutral in our programming and activities.

</div>
<div>

### How many members does OHA have?

At the end of our first year we had over 90 member families with over 300 individuals making up OHA membership. It is a wonderful community to join!

<div>

### What does OHA membership offer?

OHA aims to support the role of the parent by offering meetings, special events, field trips, and educational opportunities. We hope to connect you to the larger local homeschool community, building friendships and social support.

<div>

### Where do my membership dollars go?

OHA is a volunteer, member-run organization. Half of the membership money ($30) goes directly to Homeschool NY/LEAH to pay for insurance and our not for profit status (along with many other benefits). The other $30 goes to OHA to provide events, programs, pay rent, and more. As a not for profit 501c3 organization, ALL of the income for OHA goes directly back to benefit OHA members in some way or another. Members of OHA have access to the annual budget as well as quarterly financial reports for the association. The annual report is approved by a majority vote of OHA members.
